- No specialized hardware is required. The analysis can be performed on a standard desktop with ≥16GB RAM recommended for full dataset runs.

## 2. Installation Guide

✅ **Instructions**  
Clone the repository and install dependencies via `pip`:

✅ **Typical install time on a "normal" desktop computer**  
Installation typically completes in under 2 minutes with a stable internet connection.

## 3. Demo

✅ **Instructions to run on data**  
To reproduce the main figures and results:

To begin, load the input dataset located in the ‘demo dataset’ folder. Then, sequentially execute each Jupyter notebook in the ‘code’ folder.

✅ **Expected output**  
- `results/` will include:
  - Divergence metrics over time  
  - Topic evolution plots  
  - Co-authorship network metrics  
  - Reproduction of key figures from the manuscript

✅ **Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer**  
- Full analysis on the sample data runs in ~5–10 minutes  
- Full-scale dataset (~500,000 pairs) may take several hours depending on hardware

## 4. Instructions for Use

✅ **How to run the software on your data**  
To apply the pipeline to your own mentor-mentee data:

--input your_data.csv --sequentially execute each Jupyter notebook in the ‘code’ folder --output your_results/


Ensure your data follows the expected schema:
```csv
mentee_id, mentor_id, year, mentee_publications, mentor_publications, coauthorships, topics
```

✅ **(OPTIONAL) Reproduction instructions**  
To reproduce all quantitative results in the manuscript:


This script will:
- Run all key analysis modules  
- Generate figures and tables used in the paper  
- Export a summary of statistical models and results
